# I had a program "tools/write_zone/zbc_writezone2.c" that can run trace
# format:

~$ ./zbc_write_zone2
# Usage: /home/fwu/libzbc/.libs/lt-zbc_write_zone2 [options] <dev>
# Write into zone(s) based on the specified <script>
#Options:
#-v          : verbose mode
#-s          : (sync) Run zbc_flush after writing
#-p <script> : the <script> to be processed
#    -k <num_run>: repeat the script for <num_run> times

# I had a example, which I wrote to sequentially and randomly write to a set of zones
# see "bench_fwu/working_set_wp_lba" and "bench_fwu/working_set_rand_lba"
# you can run by:

cd bench_fwu/working_set_wp_lba
sudo ./run.sh

# and

cd bench_fwu/working_set_rand_lba
sudo ./run.sh

# Hope this could be useful
